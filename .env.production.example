# Production Environment Variables

# ===============================================
# GITHUB PAGES DEPLOYMENT
# ===============================================
# For GitHub Pages, APP_URL is automatically set in config/environment.js
# Default: https://aborovkov.github.io/anime-sync
#
# No environment variables needed - just run: yarn deploy

# ===============================================
# VERCEL/NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT (Optional)
# ===============================================
# If deploying to Vercel/Netlify instead of GitHub Pages:

# Application URL (only required environment variable)
# APP_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app

# ===============================================
# THAT'S IT!
# ===============================================
# No API credentials needed for deployment!
# Users provide their own Trakt, MAL, and ids.moe keys in the Settings page.
#
# Deployment Instructions (GitHub Pages):
# 1. Run: yarn deploy
# 2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings (gh-pages branch)
# 3. Users will configure their own API keys when they first use the app
#
# Deployment Instructions (Vercel/Netlify):
# 1. Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
# 2. Set APP_URL in environment variables
# 3. Users will configure their own API keys when they first use the app
#
# Benefits:
# - Zero deployment complexity
# - Each user has isolated rate limits
# - No shared API credentials to manage
# - Better privacy (no centralized credential storage)
